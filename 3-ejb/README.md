# 3 - EJB Notes

A very brief introduction to some of the Java EE concepts used within Avaloq.



## 1. Demo `BookEJB`
Walk thought the structure of the project, paying attention to:
- JPA Entities
- `persistence.xml`, including the `jta-datatsoure` (show in `standalone.xml` and the JBoss Admin Console)
- `BookEJB`, including the `@Stateless` and `@LocalBean` annotations and how we implement `BookEJBRemote`.
- Examine `BookEJBRemote` and it's use of the `@Remote` annotation.
- Examine `BookController` which is referencing `BookEJB` via the local view and <u>not</u> the `BookEJBRemote` interface (the remote view).
